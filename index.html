            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Surafel T. Maru, and I am a passionate and dedicated physician with a profound commitment to serving my community. My journey in medicine began with a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Gondar. This solid foundation propelled me into the heart of rural Ethiopia, where I dedicated two years to improving healthcare at Bibugn Primary Hospital in East Gojam. There, I not only performed my clinical duties with diligence but also took on the role of a quality officer, ensuring the highest standards of patient care.</p>
            <p>My career path led me to the bustling capital city, Addis Ababa, where I honed my skills in critical care and emergency medicine. I served in the adult ICU and medical wards at Teklehaimanot General Hospital and managed acute emergencies at Ethiotebib General Hospital. These experiences enriched my clinical acumen and deepened my understanding of complex medical conditions.</p>
            <p>Driven by a desire to specialize, I pursued advanced training in neurology at Addis Ababa University. Today, I am proud to serve as an attending physician neurologist at Takulo Voluntary Hospital, where I continue to apply my expertise to help patients navigate neurological challenges. My journey is fueled by a relentless drive to make a difference, one patient at a time.</p>
